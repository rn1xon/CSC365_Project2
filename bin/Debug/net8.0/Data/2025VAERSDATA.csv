Work-up includes basic lab work, abdominal imaging, and even invasive procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Although up to 30% of strictures are benign, the majority are malignant in the form of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. As a result, a multidisciplinary approach is vital to differentiate between the 2. Case Description/Methods: A 30-year-old man with no past medical history presented with a rash, fatigue, and jaundice for 1 week. Of note, the patient was exposed to a bat in his home that had tested positive for rabies. He had subsequently completed the 3 vaccine series 5 days prior to arrival. Denied alcohol use, drug use, recent travel, new medications/supplements, or high-risk sexual behavior. On arrival, aspartate aminotransferase 165, alanine transaminase 372, total bilirubin 9.2, and direct bilirubin 6.6. Serological and infectious work-up unrevealing. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed focal narrowing of common hepatic duct. ERCP/endoscopic ultrasound showed reactive periportal lymphadenopathy causing compression of common hepatic duct. The stricture was dilated and the patient received 2 biliary stents in left and right hepatic duct. Subsequent liver biopsy consistent with cholestatic hepatitis. Surgical pathology following stent removal negative for malignancy. Liver function tests normalized on outpatient follow-up. Discussion: The exact incidence of biliary strictures is unknown. In individuals with accompanying obstructive jaundice, the stricture should be considered malignant unless proven otherwise. Common etiologies of benign biliary strictures include iatrogenic (post-procedure), chronic pancreatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Rarely in the literature is reactive lymphadenopathy a cause of obstruction. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history and physical, as well as prompt imaging to establish a diagnosis.  Initial information received on 30-Dec-2024 via Other Health Care Professional regarding an unsolicited valid serious case issued from a literature article:   This case involves a 30-year-old male patient who experienced reactive periportal lymphadenopathy, biliary stricture secondary to reactive periportal lymphadenopathy following rabies vaccination series (bile duct stenosis) and cholestatic hepatitis while receiving vaccine Rabies Vaccine (Latency: unknown).  The patient's past medical treatment(s), vaccination(s) and family history were not provided. Patient with no past medical history.  On an unknown date, the patient was exposed to a bat in his home that had tested positive for rabies. He had subsequently completed the 3-vaccine series of Rabies Vaccine produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site 5 days prior to arrival. Denied alcohol use, drug use, recent travel, new medications/supplements, or high-risk sexual behavior.  On an unknown date, the patient presented with a rash, fatigue, and jaundice for 1 week.

2819138,01/02/2025,CT,,,,F,,"Acute Autoimmune Hepatitis After COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a literature report for the following literature source(s).  The author presented a rare case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) following COVID-19 vaccination, highlighting emerging concerns about vaccine-induced autoimmune diseases. A 57-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with jaundice and excessive fatigue for 2 weeks. She denied recent travel, medications, or alcohol use but had received a booster dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine just before the onset of symptoms. Examination showed scleral icterus. Blood work revealed elevated levels of bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hepatic echotexture with a ""starry sky"" appearance, consistent with acute hepatitis. More workup revealed a positive ANA screen with a 1:1280 titer and cytoplasmic pattern. Antimitochondrial antibody was positive. Liver biopsy showed multiple portal tracts expanded by plasma cell-predominant inflammatory infiltrate with severe interface activity. The remaining hepatic parenchyma showed extensive lobular disarray with multiacinar collapse, apoptotic hepatocytes, and ceroid-containing macrophages. Overall, the findings are consistent with acute AIH. She was subsequently given IV methylprednisolone 40 mg daily, resulting in marked improvement (Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): 21, notes: Day-30; 479, notes: Day 7; 725, notes: Day 4; 805, notes: Day 3 steroid started; 834, notes: Day 2; 950, notes: Day 1; Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): 16, notes: Day-30; 385, notes: Day 7; 595, notes: Day 4; 830, notes: Day 3 steroid started; 844, notes: Day 2; 903, notes: Day 1; bilirubin direct: 0.4, notes: Day -30; 3.8, notes: Day 7; 8.6, notes: Day-1; Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP): 65, notes: Day-30; 171, notes: Day 7; 216, notes: Day 4; 204, notes: Day 3 steroid started; 210, notes: Day 2; 242, notes: Day 1; bilirubin, total: 1.2, notes: Day-30; 7.0, notes: Day 7; 13.2, notes: Day 4; 13.0, notes: Day 3 steroid started; 11.2, notes: Day 2; 10.7, notes: Day 1). She was discharged with oral steroids and scheduled for hepatology follow-up. Discussion: The presence of ceroid-containing macrophages and lobular disarray/hepatocytic necrosis, along with recent immunization, raises suspicion for drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. AIH cases following COVID-19 vaccination range from 27 to 82 years of age, mostly in females, and occur after any vaccine dose. The time of symptom onset from vaccination varies from 1 day to 1 month, with jaundice occurring in nearly all cases. Abnormal LFTs are common, but normal results do not exclude AIH. Possible mechanisms include molecular mimicry, adjuvants, epitope spreading, bystander activation, X chromosome factors, and skeptical hepatotropism of SARS-CoV-2. Steroid therapy, with or without azathioprine, shows favorable outcomes. The key question is whether subsequent COVID-19 vaccine doses are safe when immune hepatitis develops post-vaccination.; Sender's Comments: Based on the implied temporal association, a causal relationship between suspect drug and the reported event autoimmune hepatitis cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,Y,,,,N,,,,"Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:21; Comments: Day-30; Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:479; Comments: Day 7 elevated; Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:725; Comments: Day 4 elevated; Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:805; Comments: Day 3 steroid started elevated; Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:834; Comments: Day 2 elevated; Test Name: Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:950; Comments: Day 1 elevated; Test Name: Antimitochondrial antibody; Test Result: Positive  ; Test Name: ANA; Test Result: Positive  ; Comments: with a 1:1280 titer and cytoplasmic pattern; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:16; Comments: Day-30; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:385; Comments: Day 7 elevated; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:595; Comments: Day 4 elevated; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:830; Comments: Day 3 steroid started elevated; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:844; Comments: Day 2 elevated; Test Name: Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST); Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:903; Comments: Day 1 elevated; Test Name: bilirubin direct; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:0.4; Comments: Day -30; Test Name: bilirubin direct; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:3.8; Comments: Day 7; Test Name: bilirubin direct; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:8.6; Comments: Day-1; Test Name: Liver biopsy; Result Unstructured Data: Test Result:showed multiple portal tracts expanded; Comments: by plasma cell-predominant inflammatory infiltrate with severe interface activity.

While the administration of the shot was painful, the attending pharmacist assured me that this was normal and advised that I might experience soreness in the area for up to 48 hours.

On unknown dates, the patient was vaccinated with haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate) (manufacturer unknown), measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (oka-merck) virus vaccine live (manufacturer unknown), tetanus vaccine (unspecified), diphtheria vaccine (unspecified), Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine (unspecified) and rubeola vaccine (unspecified) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot# and expiry date were not reported); all the suspect vaccines were administered for prophylaxis.  On an unknown date, in radiologic evaluation, the patient was found to have bilateral expansile lucent bone lesions within the maxilla and mandibular rami soap-bubble appearance. Incisional biopsy showed bland cellular fibroproliferative ovoid to spindle-shaped stromal cells with associated scattered multinucleated giant cells, irregular spicules of lamellar and woven bone, and small-caliber intralesional blood vessels surrounded by cuff-like deposits of eosinophilic material. Spindled lesional cells analysis was positive for vimentin, which confirmed the lesion's mesenchymal origin, and negative for S100, smooth muscle actin, and CD1a, which ruled out smooth muscle or myofibroblast proliferations, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and nerve sheath or melanocytic tumors. Giant cells analysis was positive for CD68. The Ki-67 proliferation index was low (less than 3%). Clinical laboratory results demonstrated that total B cell count was decreased, and CD27+ memory B cells were decreased, precluding the assessment of switched versus unswitched memory T cells. The patient's immunoglobin G (IgG) was less than 61 mg/dL (decreased), and the specific antibody response was absent to all vaccines tested; tetanus IgG was less than 0.1 IU/mL, diphtheria IgG was less than 0.1 IU/mL, Haemophilus influenzae B IgG was less than 0.15 ug/mL, measles IgG was less than 25 AU/mL, rubella IgG was less than 1 (index), varicella zoster vaccine response was less than 135.000 (index), rubeola vaccine response was absent, and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine response was absent. Natural killer (NK) function was absent. A limited serum inflammatory cytokine panel showed only that soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor level was 1318 pg/mL (mildly elevated). Exome sequencing showed a heterozygous phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) variant.  The outcome of the event of vaccine induced antibody absent was not reported.  The authors considered the event of vaccine induced antibody absent as related to suspect vaccines.  A copy of the published article is attached as further documentation of the patient's experience.

The patient's concurrent conditions included cherubism and chronic sinusitis with constant nasal congestion. Medical history included severe diarrhea and anal fissures from ages 6 months to 1 year, which resolved spontaneously, recurrent otitis media (as a young child), requiring bilateral myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion, speech delay, several episodes of pneumonia, a recurring blistering rash, granuloma annulare diagnosed at age 7, and intermittent hives on the arms and face accompanied by flushing, which appeared to be triggered by temperature changes. Her concomitant vaccines included tetanus vaccine (unspecified) and pneumococcal 13 valent vaccine.  On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (oka-merck) virus vaccine live (manufacturer unknown) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot# and expiry date were not reported), administered for prophylaxis.  On an unknown date, the patient sought care for worsening cheek swelling. Physical examination was notable for bilateral maxillary and mandibular fullness and right proptosis. Computed tomographic imaging of the paranasal sinuses showed expansile soft tissue and lucent lesions in the bilateral maxillary bone and bilateral angles of the mandible suggestive of cherubism. One of the lesions was also noted to extend into the floor of the right orbit. Serum immunoglobulin levels were normal. Lymphocyte phenotyping showed normal T-cell numbers and mild B-cell lymphopenia. Antibody levels for Streptococcus pneumoniae showed protection against 3 of 13 serotypes 7 years after receipt of conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. The patient was revaccinated, and after revaccination, the patient developed immunity to 9 of 13 serotypes. Tetanus immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 0.2 IU/mL (reference range: less than 0.1 not protective), measles IgG was less than 13.50 AU/mL, mumps IgG was less than 9 AU/mL, rubella IgG was 26.50 (index), and varicella zoster vaccine response showed more than 4000.00 (index). Natural killer (NK) cells were 0.9 lytic units (minimally reduced). Serum inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels were measured, showing the following results: soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor level was 1366.9 pg/mL (mildly elevated), IL-6 was 4.1 pg/mL (mildly elevated), IL-10 was 17.1 pg/mL (mildly elevated), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) was 965 pg/mL (mildly elevated), and IL-18 was 592 pg/mL (mildly elevated). Targeted single gene sequencing for SH3BP2 showed no variants of significance. Trio exome sequencing showed a de novo variant of unknown significance in the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) gene. Flow cytometric measurement of lymphocyte calcium flux after surface receptor activation showed markedly enhanced B-cell calcium flux with relatively normal T-cell calcium flux.   The outcome of the event of vaccine induced antibody absent was not reported.  The authors considered the event of vaccine induced antibody absent as related to suspect vaccine.  A copy of the published article is attached as further documentation of the patient's experience.  This is one of two reports referring to the same literature article.

The aim of the article was to investigate importance of a thorough history and physical, as well as prompt imaging to establish a diagnosis of biliary strictures.  Biliary strictures can be a challenging diagnosis. Work-up includes basic lab work, abdominal imaging, and even invasive procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (FRCP). Although up to 30% of strictures are benign, the majority are malignant in the form of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. As a result, a multidisciplinary approach is vital to differentiate between the 2.  The patient's had no medical history.   The patient's concomitant medication was not provided. As reported, the patient denied alcohol use, drug use, recent travel, new medications/supplements, or high-risk sexual behavior.  On unspecified date, the patient was exposed to a bat and tested positive for rabies.  On unspecified date, unknown time after exposed to bat, reported as 'five days prior arrival', the patient started and completed three series of rabies vaccine along with device constituents prefilled syringe, needle for injection and needle for reconstitution (brand name: unknown; batch number: unknown), at an unknown dose, route, and site of administration, for indication rabies vaccination.   On unspecified date, unknown time after vaccination with rabies vaccine, the patient presented with a rash, fatigue, and jaundice for one week.   On unspecified date, as reported on arrival, the patient's laboratory examinations showed aspartate aminotransferase was165, alanine transaminase was 372, total bilirubin was 9.2, and direct bilirubin was 6.6 (units not reported). Serological and infectious work-up unrevealing. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed focal narrowing of common hepatic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)/endoscopic ultrasound showed reactive periportal lymphadenopathy causing compression of common hepatic duct. The stricture was dilated and the patient received two biliary stents in left and right hepatic duct. Subsequent liver biopsy consistent with cholestatic hepatitis. Surgical pathology following stent removal negative for malignancy. Liver function tests normalized on outpatient follow-up.  As reported, in individuals with accompanying obstructive jaundice, the stricture should be considered malignant unless proven otherwise. Common etiologies of benign biliary strictures include iatrogenic (post-procedure), chronic pancreatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Rarely in the literature is reactive lymphadenopathy a cause of obstruction. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history and physical, as well as prompt imaging to establish a diagnosis  At the time of initial report, it was unknown if the patient recovered from the events of 'bile duct stenosis', and 'cholestatic hepatitis'.  The reported assessed the event of 'bile duct stenosis', and 'cholestatic hepatitis' as serious due to criteria of hospitalization, additionally, the events were considered as serious due to criteria of medical significance.

The clinical rhabdomyolysis syndrome, resulting from muscle disintegration, can be the result of numerous etiologic events and have serious sequelae. The pedal manifestations result from muscular and neurologic insult. The patient in this reported case survived rhabdomyolysis despite renal and hepatic failure requiring diuresis and hemodialysis. The only permanent long-term sequelae the patient suffered was flexible hammertoe deformities and parasthesias of all lesser digits of both feet. The follow-up is over 8 years.  Initial information received on 30-Dec-2024 via other healthcare professional regarding an unsolicited valid serious case issued from a literature article:   This case involves a 30-year-old female patient who experienced rhabdomyolysis (Latency: 1 week), renal failure, tibial nerve palsy and liver failure following rhabdomyolysis (Hepatic failure) (Renal failure) while receiving influenza vaccine (Latency: unknown).  The patient's past medical treatment(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer lot number not reported via unknown route in unknown administration site 1 week earlier.  The patient recalled a previous reaction to the influenza vaccine 1 year earlier that consisted of high fever, rigor, and myalgia exactly 1 week postimmunization.   Patient presented to Medical Center after collapsing upon completion of a 2-mile run (Circulatory collapse). The patient related profound weakness (asthenia), abdominal pain, bilateral leg pain (pain in extremity), lower extremity parasthesias (Paraesthesia), and shortness of breath (dyspnoea) followed by a syncopal episode (syncope). Prior to admission, she denied any illness, medication use, allergies, diet changes, or drug use.   Initial objective findings were a pulse of 150, oral temperature of 103F, tachypnea (tachypnoea), and a blood pressure of 53/83. Overall, she was pallorous (pallor) and had generalized weakness (asthenia). The lower extremity exam showed palpable pulses, moderate pitting edema extending to both her thighs (oedema), and hyperesthesias of the feet and posterior lower leg bilaterally (Hyperaesthesia). Her lab studies were remarkable for elevated creatinine phosphokinase of greater then 150,000 units, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) of 74, serum creatinine of 12.1, and elevated LFT' s (liver function tests) (SGOT (Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase)= 7373, SGPT (Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase)= 3707) and the presence of heme proteins on the urinalysis.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis with concurrent hepatic and renal failure, and tibial nerve palsy (Peripheral nerve palsy). Diagnosis was made based on the history, clinical symptomatology, and laboratory diagnostic testing. The patient was treated with aggressive diuresis and hemodialysis for 11/2months, and was discharged from the hospital with improved musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal function. Approximately 18 months following the episode of rhabdomyolysis, the patient fully recovered from renal and liver failure. The only residual symptoms noted were confined to her lower extremities, in association with her nerve palsy. Her chief complaint consisted of episodic pain (pain) with minimal pressure (sub metatarsals on weightbearing) and a the sensation of ""a rolled up sock in her right shoe."" She also noted the development of hammering of the lesser toes (foot deformity). Upon physical examination, there was xerosis of the right foot (xerosis). There was also decreased sensation in both feet from plantar mid arch and lesser metatarsophalangeal joints distally and the posterior distal one third of the leg, bilaterally. A positive Tinel's sign and valleix phenomenon were noted over the posterior tibial nerves . Flexible hammertoes (2-5) were noted bilateral with the right foot being worse. EMG (electromyogram)/nerve conduction studies were performed and revealed a decreased amplitude and conduction velocity of both posterior tibial nerves. The right side demonstrated more severe pathologic changes. The findings were consistent with right tibial nerve palsy and left partial tibial nerve palsy.

On December 4th he started vomiting (7 times within 24 hours), then developed a 102 temperature next day. He was lethargic and had random outbursts of pain and discomfort. After 3 days of him being lethargic, not mobile, won't walk, won't talk,  has no interest in anything, and hasn't smiled, something was wrong. We took him to Urgent Care then they wanted me to take him to the ER By the time we took him there, his neck was stiff and he was curling his back and wouldn't rest.  I was worried about Meningitis but the stiff neck was really the only symptom. He was and still is irritable, won't move, and is in pain.  X-ray came back normal, no ammonia.  Sonogram came back normal Blood work came back ok.        What's interesting is that Monday night at bedtime when I was holding him upright, he suddenly thrusted his neck back and arched his back. I remember his eyes looking at me but he wasn't crying. He is a strong kid and sometimes will forcefully move when he wants out of my arms but this was different. I laid him back as I continued to feel force. I think at that time something internally was happening and the thrust gave him Torticollis. What I mentioned to the Urgent Care & Emergency Room visits is that he was given the MMR shot less than 3 weeks of all this happening. I'd like it noted and recorded in his records. that he had this adverse reaction to the vaccine.?  This was the first vaccine where he developed a high fever the next day and ever since that vaccine he has been fussier than he typically is.?  If he really had Neurovirus or a stomach flu - both highly contagious, no one else in the house got it.?  We think the vomiting, fever, neck thrusting, stiff neck, and arched back area an adverse reaction from the metals in the MMR vaccine. This was an is still very scary.

The patient denied excessive handwashing. The patient had no history of daily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use but had a recent 2-week prior history of pm re nata (PRN) ibuprofen use. There was no known family history of atopy, renal disease, pulmonary disease, AF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) allele mutation, or breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutation. The patient was convalescent for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) 3 months prior, which was successfully treated with a full course of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (PAXLOVIDTM, Pfizer), resulting in complete recovery without any COVID-19-related hospitalization. The patient was  fully vaccinated prior to infection which, at the time, constituted a total of three vaccine doses. Post-COVID self-administered rapid COVID-19 viral antigen tests were negative. The patient denied any post-COVID-19 conditions, also known as post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PASC) or long COVID.  Prior to presentation, the patient obtained photographic documentation of ASK on 2 separate occasions. On presentation, both palms appeared unremarkable; however, upon brief exposure to water for 2 minutes, the clinical signs of ASK became apparent with moderate involvement of the thumb and index fingers. There was no pedal involvement or involvement of other areas. The patient denied pain, discomfort, pruritis, and burning sensation. The patient declined therapeutic intervention, including topical steroids, topical aluminum chloride solution, and antihistamines.  Workup for associated conditions was negative. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) was also unremarkable, excluding nephrotic syndrome or other associated renal involvement. Sodium - 139 mmol/L [Standard range (SR): 135-146 mmol/L], Potassium - 4.7 mmol/L (SR: 3.5-5.3 mmol/L), Chloride 103 mmol/L (SR: 98-110 mmol/L), CO2 - 30 mmol/L (SR: 21-31), BUN - 12 mg/dL (SR: 8-24 mg/dL), Glucose - 89 mg/dL (SR: 70-99 mg/dL), Creatinine - 1.04 mg/dL (SR: 0.70 - 1.30 mg/dL), Calcium - 9.4 mg/dL (SR: 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), Total protein - 7.1 g/dL (SR: 6.4 - 8.9 g/L), Albumin - 4.6 g/dL (SR: 3.5 - 5.7 g/L), Total bilirubin - 0.3 mg/dL (SR: 0.0 - 1.0 mg/dL), Alkaline phosphatase - 57 IU/L or U/L (SR: 34 - 104 IU/L or U/L), AST (SGOT) - 18 IU/L (SR: 13 - 39 IU/L or U/L), ALT (SGPT) - 32 IU/L or U/L (SR: 7 - 52 IU/L or U/L), Anion gap - 6 mmol/L (SR: 4 - 14 mmol/L), Est. CFR - >90 ml/min/l.73 m2. Subsequent CFTR gene sequencing and single-gene deletion/duplication analysis returned negative. No pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance on the CFTR gene were identified.   Two months later, ASK appeared to have resolved. It could no longer be elicited by exposure to water or sweat, despite numerous attempts. The patient noted disappearance of white plaques and wrinkling after water exposure. Photographs of the improvement were not obtained. No known lifestyle, dietary, or medication-related changes contributed to ASK resolution.  One month later, however, ASK returned, initially characterized by palmar edema after water exposure with absence of white plaques and papules. Soon, ASK progressed in severity with development of white plaques and increased palmar area involvement. Physical discomfort with episodes of pruritis was noted. Treatment with 12% topical aluminum chloride to promote palmar anhidrosis did not lead to improvement despite 4 weeks of nightly treatment. As a result, the patient was treated with bilateral palmar botulinum toxin injections. Within 2 weeks following botulinum toxin treatment, complete resolution of ASK occurred. The affected phalangeal surfaces also resolved despite no direct injection to these locations.  Conclusions: The authors present a case of ASK in an adult male months following COVID-19 infection without a history of excessive handwashing. Near resolution 2 months after ASK onset was followed by recurrence 1 month later. The patient may have had a predisposition to recurrent ASK due to his history of atopy including atopic dermatitis and food allergy anaphylaxis combined with prior COVID-19 infection and sporadic, short-term NSAID use. It is possible that ASK may be a newly identified condition comprising PASC or long COVID. Clinicians should maintain heightened awareness of ASK in their patients and continue to document cases of this rare and poorly understood condition to improve clinical knowledge, treatment strategies, and future patient outcomes.  Amendment: This follow-up report is being submitted to amend previous information: Case was reassessed from invalid to valid.; Sender's Comments: A causal relationship to the suspect drug BNT162B2 NOS cannot be excluded for the event vaccination failure. Aquagenic Syringeal Keratoderma could be secondary to underlying contributory factors including COVID-19 infection. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

Full respiratory viral PCR panel was positive for COVID-19 although initial testing was negative.  Viral symptoms were treated with supportive care including Mucinex and cough suppressants.  Patient had no evidence of hypoxia during admission and had peripheral oxygen saturations in the high 90s on room air at time of discharge requiring no treatment for COVID-19.  With respect to patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, patient was started on amiodarone bolus and infusion with IV heparin transitioned back to home oral rivaroxaban.  Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm in amiodarone infusion was transitioned to amiodarone 200 mg 2 times a day in the hospital with discharged on amiodarone 200 mg daily in addition to patient's home metoprolol tartrate 25 mg 2 times a day.    Patient was initially started on IV diuretics in the setting of elevated proBNP of 9866 but had signs of hypovolemia including worsening kidney function with mildly low blood pressures and in the setting of COVID-19 viral illness, diuretics were discontinued and patient was given a small IV fluid bolus.  Patient had no clinical signs of decompensated heart failure after resolution of tachyarrhythmia.  Repeat echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, indeterminate diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.  Patient was  given IV magnesium for hypomagnesemia and given dose of IV iron sucrose for iron-deficiency anemia.  Patient was encouraged to drink more water as family reports her fluid intake is typically poor.  Patient's home Amlodipine was discontinued. Her home scheduled diuretics were changed to prn for fluid retention.    On separate note, patient has significant carotid atherosclerotic disease and was restarted on low-dose aspirin daily as she has a strong indication for antiplatelet therapy.  Patient was counseled to avoid all fish oil and cod liver oil as both can cause bleeding.  She was also tinnitus to avoid any over-the-counter adult aspirin products or NSAIDs as they also can precipitate bleeding.  On separate note patient had a low TSH and mildly elevated free T4.  T3 was checked and was low.  Typically with hyperthyroidism we would expect that T3 to be high.  Discussed with endocrinology and they recommended repeating thyroid studies including TSH, free T4 and T3 in 4 weeks and if TSH remains low with elevated free T4 and T3 patient likely might need antithyroid medications.  If 3rd said he has remain abnormal recommend referral to endocrinology.  Discharged to Home Health Care",,,,,Y,3,,,,10/22/2024,01/03/2025,73,,PVT,,,,,,,2,01/09/2025,,,,

Nothing was said about the ""Cyst"" I found it while reviewing my chart. Findings: There is a large CSF density fluid collection along the posterior left vertex and parietal lobe. There is mass effect upon the underlying brain, no edema. The appearance is most consistent with a large arachnoid cyst. Radiologist recommended follow up with primary care. I did. MRI was ordered but was denied by insurance  and took some time to get scheduled. Note: Blood work was done in the original visit November 12 and also at the ER visit November 15.   MRI Findings: What appeared to be an arachnoid cyst on the outside head CT scan is actually a moderately large area of macrocystic encephalomalacia in the left parietal lobe. There is a smaller area of milder encephalomalacia in the posterolateral, superior left occipital lobe. In terms of underlying etiology, these are nonspecific but compatible with old infarctions.

Reported home medications were atorvastatin 10 mg and fenofibrate 48 mg, both taken daily. The LFTs were subsequently normalized. The patient's partner was scheduled to be screened for HBV. The patient was educated on HBV risks and transmission. Unlike the patient, however, anti-HBs levels were only checked after the patient tested positive for an acute HBV infection after CAB/ RPV initiation. The patient's anti-HBs levels confirmed immunity with a level greater than 10 mIU per mL (14 mIU per mL). Despite this, the patient still developed an acute HBV infection. It is important to note that the patient continued to participate in high-risk behavior after the switch to CAB/RPV. Though routine laboratory results were conducted monthly, HBV tests were not routinely done during follow-ups.

2820420,01/11/2025,TX,25.0,25,,F,,"A month after taking my second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine I noticed a brown spot on the right lower leg. I thought that this was just a discoloration, or possibly a skin issue. These brown spots kept growing over time and they started apearing on the left leg too. I got pregnant with my second baby in august and I discussed my concern of the legs with my OBG/YN but he said they are not very noticeable and it could be nothing. However, these brown spots kept growing and I started having inflammation on my lower legs, therefore after the delivery in June 2022, I talked again to my OBGYN that I need to see some doctor regarding at this time swollen, inflamed spots and brown patches all over my lower legs. My OBGYN referred me to see Dr. (a vein specialist) and I was able to see him in December 2022. His assessment said that I had Superficial Vein Thrombosis and he suggested that I get an assessment from a hematologist since the SVT were very large for a young patient like me, and that he suspected occult malignancy. I was seen by Hematology in June 2023, they have done a series or Labs and a Doppler bilateral which revealed left peroneal vein thrombosis. I was put on Eliquis 5MG  twice a day for 3 months and repeated the left leg doppler in 3 months. After three months there were no improvements, therefore I was recommended to stop Eliquis and get seen by my vein specialist. After going back to the vein doctor, I was suggested to get another assessment by hematology as well as take Xarelto 20mg, and I was referred to M.D. I saw Dr in December 2023. He suggested that I do some more labs and get a CAT Scan, also treat my DVT with XARELTO 20mg for 1 year. I got my CAT Scan done in December 26, 2023 3hich showed no obvious evidence of any malignancy.  There was a small groundglass opacity in the right upper lobe. The hematologist recommended that I repeat my CAT Scan in 2024, which i did. The second CAT Scan done in October 2024 showed a growing groundglass opacity in the right upper lobe. At this time the hematologist suggested that I get seen by a Pulmonology immediately, and that I stop Xarelto in a month. I saw a pulmonary specialist the after three days, and he advised me to have a ION lung bronchoscopy done as soon as possible, and find out what is on my lung. I had my lung bronchoscopy done in 11/20/24 at clinic which revealed a lung infection due to unknown reason. The pulmonary specialist said that this infection could have been caused by a virus, but the biopsy cannot defy if a virus is the underlying reason. However, I have always suspected that my blood clots on my superficial veins and later deep vein thrombosis was a result of the COVID-19 Vaccine as I noticed the brown spots which turned to be clots right after i took the Covid-19 vaccine.

If the error is discovered while the person is still in the office, you can administer the other ""half"" of the Engerix-B dose. If the error is discovered later, the dose should not be counted. The person should be recalled to the office and given a full age-appropriate 1.0 mL repeat dose. The same recommendation would apply if the error was with Recombivax HB.""

This report was referenced in literature:  and concerned a patient of unspecified age and sex (subject number and site number were not reported). The patient's height and weight were not reported. Age at time of vaccination was unknown. Aim- The aim of this study was to evaluate the cases of herpes simplex and zoster ophthalmicus after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and assess the clinical presentations in patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cases osimplex and zoster   No past medical history, concurrent conditions or pre-existing medical conditions were reported.  The patient received janssen covd-19 vaccine (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number not reported) dose, frequency and therapy dates not reported, for covid-19 prophylaxis. Additional dosage information included: dose series 1. The batch number was not reported. The company is unable to perform follow up. Method- A retrospective analysis of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) between December 11, 2020, and July1, 2022. Patients diagnosed with herpes simplex ophthalmicus (HSO) and herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) after vaccination withBNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.-COV2.S (Janssen) were included in the study. We performed adescriptive analysis of patient demographics, history, and ophthalmic and systemic clinical presentations. The correlations between vaccine type and continuous variables were assessed by the one-way analysis of variance test. In addition, we used the Pearsonx2test to assess the association between 3 vaccines and categorical variables. A post hoc analysis was performed between HSO and HZO onset intervals after vaccination, dose, and vaccine type. The 30-day risk analysis was also performed for HSO and HZO onset postvaccination using the reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result- A total of 1180 cases of HZO (983, 83.30%) and HSO (180,15.25%) were reported. The mean age of patients with HZO and HSO was 59.02619.05 and 52.68617.83 years, respectively. Most of the cases of HZO (795, 80.87%) and HSO (131, 72.78%) were reported inpatients who received BNT162b2. In the cohort, 63.28% and 65.56%diagnosed with HZO and HSO were women. About one third of HZO(36.52%) and HSO (35.56%) cases were reported after the first dose. More than half of the cases of HZO (61.34%) and HSO (64.45%) were reported within the first 2 weeks after vaccination. The estimated crude reporting rate (per million doses) in the United States was 0.25, 0.22,and 0.47 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S, respectively. The onset interval for HZO was significantly shorter in patients who received BNT162b2 (20.51656.20 days, P= 0.030) compared with patients who received mRNA-1273 (36.566108.67 days) andAd26.COV2.S (39.66660.15 days) vaccines. The 30-day risk analysis showed a significantly higher risk of HZO after BNT162b2than the other 2 vaccines (P= 0.011).  No concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient experienced herpes zoster ophthalmic (dose series 1) and herpes simplex ophthalmicus  (dose series 1).  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable.  The outcome of herpes zoster ophthalmic and herpes simplex ophthalmicus was not reported.  The reporter considered the causality between covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s and herpes zoster ophthalmic and herpes simplex ophthalmicus as related. Company causality between covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s and herpes zoster ophthalmic and herpes simplex ophthalmicus was not related. Conclusion- The low crude reporting rate suggests that HZO and HSO after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination occur rarely. This study provides insights into the possible temporal association between reported HSO and HZO after SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; however, further investigations are required to delineate the possible underlying immunological mechanisms.   This report was serious (other medically important condition).; Sender's Comments: V0-Ophthalmic herpes zoster, Ophthalmic herpes simplex. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event.

Before his illness, he had been diagnosed with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (2011), ME/CFS (diagnosed in 2017, but began earlier), fibromyalgia, and psoriasis. Following his first COVID-19 infection, he developed tachycardia, brain fog, and mild cognitive symptoms. After his second COVID-19 infection, he developed MCAS symptoms, including frequent, mild-to-moderate sinus congestion, flushing, and throat swelling in relation to many foods. Currently, his Long COVID symptoms include brain fog, difficulty with word finding, MCAS symptoms, sensitivity to histamines, and intermittent PEM. He received one dose of the Spikevax vaccine in February 2021, two doses of the Jcovden vaccine in July and October 2021, a Comirnaty bivalent booster in October 2022, and one primary series dose of the Nuvaxovid vaccine in April 2023. In December 2022, he took a 7.5 day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during a third COVID-19 infection (confirmed by at-home molecular Lucira test and multiple rapid antigen tests). At the time, he was taking cromolyn sodium, ketitofen, low-dose naltrexone, metoprolol succinate XL, rosuvastatin, nortriptyline, modafinil, finasteride, loratadine, valacyclovir, famotidine, and nitrofurantoin daily; testosterone cypionate weekly; leuprolide quarterly; and Zofran and clonazepam as needed. His daily supplements included Deplin (algal oil), cranberry extract, laxin forte, vision optimizer blend, biotin, ubiquinol, alpha-lipoic acid, probiotics, fish oil, flaxseed oil, quercetin, vitamin C, acetyl-l-carnitine, milk thistle, P5P, calcium, skullcap and passionflower tinctures, and DAO and digestive enzymes. He also received twice-weekly injections of glutathione and methylcobalamin. During his acute COVID infection, he also took melatonin and high dose Vitamin C powder. After this course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, he experienced several days with no fatigue or notable pain, although his fatigue and pain then returned to his pre-infection baseline within 2-3 weeks. This pattern resembled his experience with his first COVID infection, in which he experienced improvements in his fatigue and chronic pain during the ten days of initial infection, while also experiencing intermittent low-grade fevers.

It was unknown if therapeutic measures were taken as a result of covid-19. Additional information: Patient given a 15-day course of Paxlovid as part of a study to see if it would improve her Long COVID symptoms. According to the media article, the patient reported experiencing significant improvement in symptoms. Case report: In May2022, a previously healthy25-year-old woman with a medical history notable only for mild seasonal allergies developed COVID-19 symptoms. The infection was confirmed via rapid antigen test. She had previously received the primary two-shot series of the COVID-19 vaccine(Comirnaty) in April2021 and a Comirnaty booster in November2021. Initially, her Long COVID symptoms were primarily gastrointestinal, including lack of appetite, bloating, weight loss and new food intolerances. Over the next few months, she developed additional symptoms, including fatigue, PEM, exercise intolerance, brainfog, headaches, noise and light sensitivity, and joint pain. In November and December2022, she was treated for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth with two courses of rifaximin, which did not lead to sustained improvement; specifically, after the first course in November, her gastrointestinal symptoms improved for two days before returning top rerifaximin baseline and after these cond course in December, there was no improvement. In January2023, she began a 10-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of  the context of an acute COVID-19infection. At the time, she was taking loratadine and a multivitamin. On day4, she experienced a severe ""crash"" characterized by increased fatigue, headache, brainfog, sound and light sensitivity, and difficulty remaining upright, walking and balancing. Approximately one month later, she had recovered from the initial crash and her fatigue and PEM had lessened meaningfully; she also experienced limited improvement in brainfog and headaches. In late February and March 2023, she switched from loratadine to fexofenadine and famotidine. In April and May2023, the fatigue, PEM, brainfog, and headache benefits dissipated and her symptoms returned to her pre-nirmaltrevir/ritonavir baseline, and she began taking quercetin, low-dosenaltrexone, and a pro-biotic. As of July2023, she was experiencing some improvements in symptoms,was slowly reintroducing foodsnot tolerated earlier in her disease course, and added gentle swimming multiple times per week with out PEM. She also began a 3-month course of valacyclovir with celecoxib, given the irantiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, respectively, but observed no benefits.; Sender's Comments: Vaccine efficacy varies from person to person and is affected by many factors.

Clinical course: A 29-year-old man had clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in May2022 and Jul2022. His symptoms appeared to resolve fully after his first infection. After his second infection, his acute symptoms resolve after three weeks, at which time his Long COVID symptoms arose. His Long COVID symptoms include extreme fatigue, PEM, tachycardia, POTS, persistent headache, brain fog, chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion, and unrefreshing sleep; he met the myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnostic criteria. Since the onset of his Long COVID symptoms, he also developed constipation, chilblains, atopic dermatitis on his face, and paresthesia. His abnormal test results include high cholesterol and prominent Virchow spaces on a brain MRI. Before his initial infection, he had received three doses of the Comirnaty vaccine (Mar2021, Apr2021, and Nov2021). He received an additional dose of the Spikevax vaccine in Oct2022. In May2023, he began a 15-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute COVID-19 infection. Concomitant medications included finasteride, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts, bupropion, atenolol, midodrine, Vitamin D3, and famotidine. Approximately six days  into the course, he noticed slight (""~10%"") improvement in his fatigue and brain fog. These improvements were sustained and increased to ""~20%"" by the end of the course. His 15 days on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir also coincided with the longest number of consecutive days (15) without any worsening of symptoms (e.g., a crash). However, two days after the final nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose, he experienced a PEM crash, which included a sore burning sensation in his arms, poor sleep, headache, fatigue, and brain fog so intense that sitting, moving, and talking was difficult. He returned to his pre-nirmatrelvir/ritonavir Long COVID baseline within five days.

She tried various treatment options (Tylenol, topicals, patches, etc.) to manage the side effects, but nothing worked. She was still experiencing the side effects. She also mentioned that she noticed something unusual with the person who administered the vaccine, which she did not experience with her previous vaccines.

It did not say anything about Pfizer, it had a chemical name on it and that was a shame on her. Patient should have put that in front of herself. She figured it started with the C8, something. Anyway, to make a long story short, her arm that they gave her that injection has been aching ever since and She went back to them about three weeks ago because she used the store and she went up steps over to the counter about that until she said listen she need to pick up something for her own home record that she had this shot, that they gave it to her and she asked them, was there anything they can give her or what will they suggest? It feels like she had a tetanus shot, she does not know if Pfizer are familiar with tetanus shot but they hurt like she do not know what. They make arm ache and that was what she experiencing and it has been three, 3 months ago now and she wanted to know now because they do not give her anything to prep Pfizer or to inform Pfizer of any side effects. Asked is this a normal side effect of her arm to keep aching and that was right on that site where they gave her that injection? Like her arm being broken into or something."" When paraphrased the above concern, consumer stated, ""Yes. Maybe a little she was trying to see what was going on three months, yes and everybody there was nice but very nice weather and she had it so yes. She was worried about it now because now when she lift her arm, she have to be careful and now she do not see no bruises there, that was another thing. There was something else going on so.

Additional information: patient received all the vaccines and boosters when they were released except for the fourth one which he probably waited 6 months to get and to his memory all were Pfizer except for maybe his fourth or fifth dose of the covid vaccines that he had which were Moderna. Patient stated with the Pfizer covid vaccine he had in Apr2024, he had swelling of the lymph nodes and swelling under his arms about two weeks which was not very much but received it with the RSV vaccine, influenza vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine; he has no manufacturer names or lot numbers to provide for the RSV vaccine, influenza vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine and there is no way to tell which he reacted to; he did not have any noticeable reaction to any other covid vaccines he had. He thinks the 2nd one he had he was a little tired with but that's it and that one was definitely Pfizer and the first two he had were Pfizer. The negative reaction one he had in Apr2024 was the one he had with a group of four other vaccines and he can't say whether or not it had to do with the covid vaccine and could not really single that out and does not have an opinion on whether it was the covid or not and he suspected it was not as he was reading up on other vaccines when he had them. Patient confirmed the other vaccines he had were the RSV vaccine, influenza vaccine and a pneumonia vaccine despite having said previously it was four. This one vaccine he had just about 5 weeks ago, he just stopped reacting to. Patient clarified he had no swelling with the most recent vaccine and no did not get any and did not experience any swelling and this dose was definitely Pfizer. With that vaccine, he got tired, had no fever that he could measure and he felt like he had the flu for about 60 hours and like he was getting flu about 60 hours and was tired and had some fatigue, muscle aching and a little bit of shortness of breath and generally overall feeling like oncoming influenza and he did not experience anything more than normal pain.  States pain is the wrong word, but it was soreness at the injection site for that period of time of like 60 hours and was sore where the injection site was and the site was a little swollen for like 60 hours.  States these symptoms of being tired, muscle aching, and shortness of breath began and he had received the vaccine on 05Dec2024 in the afternoon and had the negative reaction on 06Dec2024, 07Dec2024 and through 08Dec2024. It seemed very unusual and he is certain it was different for him than other vaccines he had had. He did not have any reactions before not that he noticed anyways.Clarified that his Moderna vaccine was three vaccines back and was not the 4th or 5th one but probably was the 4th one but he is not sure. The most recent vaccine was on 05Dec2024 and he does not know the dosage but it was administered to his left shoulder. After the initial reaction subsided underneath his armpit of the left arm where the injection was, states he has slight food reactions and allergies and pollen allergy and has asthma and that is ongoing. He took Tylenol and states it was Acetaminophen and he takes that steadily as he has some back problems and has some substantial pollen allergies and asthma and has only had what he calls hives and itching two to three times in his entire life and his left arm was increasingly itchy until about three days ago for the entire period of time and he thought he might be having a reaction to some deodorant he used and used the deodorant one to two times during that time period.Towards the end he realized he had tenderness and soreness like muscle aching in the entire upper arm and shoulder area until about 3 days ago. The itching and hives were in the upper arm the entire time and the soreness at the shoulder that was injected in, he did not get any lymph node swelling as he did previously with other injections and never had reactions like this after 3.5 to 4.5 weeks. There was no other cause other than this dosage of the vaccine.Other medical conditions included he does not think this affects this but he has chronic lymphocytic leukemia and it is inactive because it is monitored. He did not realize what this was and it not occur to him it was cause by the vaccine and he experienced itchy underarm the whole month and after he realized it was the vaccine. States he is having trouble with his voice being hoarse.

On 24-AUG-2021 and 08-NOV-2021, the patient was vaccinated with the first and second dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) intramuscular injection, respectively, administered to prevent cancer (also reported as preventing cervical cancer) (strength, dose, frequency, lot #, expiry date, anatomical location, and route of administration were not provided).  Within weeks of receiving the second quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) dose, on an unspecified date in 2021,  the patient experienced her nose and ears turning red from inflammation. She had rashes all over her body and crippling joint pain. The redness and inflammation were severe enough to cause her eyes to appear black, and her ears to swell shut. She began suffering from headaches. She scheduled an appointment with an eyes, nose, and throat (ENT) who conducted several blood tests (results not provided) before being diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis by one ENT and confirmed by another ENT before being treated for her diagnosis. She was informed that her condition was extremely rare, and she was the only patient in her physician's system with this condition. Patient was also informed that her illness might necessitate heart surgery or the use of a ventilator as she ages. Patient endured daily joint pain, dizziness, swelling, redness in her nose and ears, rashes, and throat irritation. On 20-APR-2022, the patient was vaccinated with the third dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) intramuscular injection. She was currently prescribed three medications, one of which was given by infusion and not covered by insurance. Some of the medication had caused hair loss and painful mouth sores, and another carries the risk of retinal detachment. Along with seeing her ENT, she needed continuous monitoring of labs and future cardiologist appointments to monitor her heart. Before the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) vaccine, patient eagerly anticipated starting a family and completing her PhD. She maintained a 4.0 GPA, graduated with her master's degree, and held a full-time job. She enjoyed exercise and visiting the zoo, but now cannot because of her joint pain and exhaustion. She had contemplated taking time from school and leaving the job she loved due to the difficulties of commuting caused by her joint pain. Because her future health was uncertain, she was now uncertain about starting a family. Patient contended that her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine injections caused her to develop relapsing polychondritis, as well as a constellation of adverse symptoms, complications, injuries, and other adverse events, many of which are alleged herein and all of which were caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) or otherwise linked to her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced autoimmune disorder.

As a direct and proximate result of her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced injuries, patient had suffered and continued to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished income capacity, and she would continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future.

2821690,01/18/2025,,16.0,16,,F,,"I came into the hospital in the beginning of November with face numbness. Almost the entirety of the right side of my face was numb and when I would touch it I could not feel it. The doctors decided to give me a CT scan of my head, after that I had an MRI (no contrast,) that?s where they found a lesion on my brain stem. There was another lesion but it was very very small closer to the top of my head. They weren't sure if it was a tumor at first or something else so I had to go back and get an MRI with contrast this time and they saw that it was in fact a lesion. I was then admitted to the hospital over a period of 5 days in the middle of November. They had me hooked up to an IV over those 5 days with a heavy dose of steroids. (I believe it was 1,000 mg but I could be wrong.) Later they did another MRI on my neck to make sure there were no lesions there (I was clear.) I got a chest x-ray done just as a precaution (nothing was found there.) They took about 30 vials of blood in total during that month of me in and out of the hospital (it all looked normal.) They ended up diagnosing me with Isolated Case Syndrome, but they are talking about treating me for Multiple Sclerosis. They can?t say that it is Multiple Sclerosis due to the fact that there were not enough lesions to pinpoint it on that. My face numbness went away after the steroids and I was released from the hospital. It?s been a couple months since November and I have been nauseous most days and I have migraines most days. They gave me medicine to subside that and it helps and it has been a lot more manageable since then. I am not sure if this is related to the COVID-19 Pfizer shot but seeing that nothing in my life has changed before I had the shot or after it?s safe to assume that this could have definitely been the cause of what I may have.

He was limp for about two minutes then was very sleepy/hard to engage or arouse for some forty to sixty minutes"". Parents noted later the child shivering and having intermittent chills. In the Emergency Department the child had a temperature of 38.8 degree C and pulse of 185. A urine analysis and urine culture were ordered, and obtained the following day on 02Nov2019. The child was given PO Motrin in the Emergency Department on 01Nov2019. The child was discharged on 01Nov2019 to home with a diagnosis of Febrile Seizure. Before discharge he was afebrile, adequately hydrating. The tachycardia was likely related to his fevers. Teaching was discussed regarding antifebrile medications as well as aggressive oral rehydration. The child was discharged in good condition on 01Nov2019. The child continued on around the clock Motrin and Tylenol alternating each medication until 03Nov2019. He was seen for follow-up on 02Nov2019.

2822370,01/23/2025,MA,,,,M,,"Severe bullous eruption; It was reported in a published article title as stated below that a life-threatening episodes of mast cell activation can occur in diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM), a rare form of pediatric mastocytosis with reported incidence of 1-8%. Bullous eruptions in DCM have been reported after trauma, infections and medication administration. The article presented a child with generalized bullous eruption after routine vaccination.  A 5-month-old child received scheduled vaccination with Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent (ROTATEQ) Orally (dose, frequency, lot number and expiration date were not reported) and Hemophilus influenzae B, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), poliomyelitis (inactivated), and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (dose, route, frequency, lot number and expiration date were not reported). Total and mature tryptase levels and skin pathology were evaluated.  The patient was diagnosed with DCM at 3 months based on the peau d'orange appearance of his skin with positive Darier sign. Total tryptase was 64 with mature fraction of 3.1, urinary histamine 873 creatinine. Skin biopsy revealed a patchy band-like infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the dermis positive for tryptase and CD117. Therapy with H1 and H2-antagonists and topical sodium cromoglycate was initiated. A day after his routine vaccination at 5 months, he developed systemic generalized life-threatening symptoms with clear-fluid-filled blisters associated with nausea, vomiting, fevers and generalized malaise. A 5-day course of 0.5 mg/kg oral steroids led to complete resolution with no residual skin changes.  Vaccinations are an under-recognized trigger for blistering in children with DCM. Premedication and vaccine administration on one-at-a-time basis may reduce the severity. Systemic steroids improve outcomes.  Bullous eruption was considered to be life-threatening by the authors.  Follow up information was received. A 5-month-old boy presented for evaluation of a raised apparently pruritic rash with episodic blisters. He was the product of an uncomplicated, full-term pregnancy with normal delivery. At 2 months of age, the skin of his abdomen and back became progressively rough and stiff with wheal formation surrounded by ""raw"" red areas of flare at the site of physical stroking. Skin biopsy was obtained from the right flank to confirm a suspected diagnosis of diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM). Review of systems was noteworthy for history of colicky abdominal pain. There was no history of wheezing, loss of consciousness, diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal distention. He was following his growth curve and reached all age-appropriate developmental milestones. Physical examination on an unspecified date showed an alert, well-appearing boy in no evident distress, appropriately interactive. No lymphadenopathy or organomegaly was observed. Skin was notable for confluent skin-colored papules and plaques with peau d'orange appearance covering his trunk with urtication on minimal touch . Hyperpigmented patches of several centimeters in diameter were present on the extremities. On an unknown date, Laboratory results showed a 24-hour collection urinary histamine level of 873 microgram/gram creatinine. (reference range <35 microgram/gram creatinine), total serum tryptase of 64 nanogram/milliliter (ng/ml) (reference range<15 ng/mL), and mature tryptase of 3.1 ng/mL (reference range, <1 ng/mL). Blood cell counts on an unknown date were 12000 white blood cells/micro liter, 4690 red blood cells/microliter, and 473000 platelets/microliter with mild eosinophilia of 550 microliter, and otherwise normal differential. On an unknown date, Liver function tests were normal (alanine aminotransferase, 23 micro kat/Liter; aspartate aminotransferase, 34 micro kat/L). Lesional skin biopsy on an unknown date showed a patchy band-like infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the superficial dermis. lmmunostaining for tryptase and CD117 on an unknown date was positive, confirming that the infiltrate primarily consisted of mast cells. The diagnosis of DCM was made on the basis of these clinical and histopathologic findings. At 5 months of age, on an unknown date, the patient received his scheduled 4-month vaccinations with rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, pentavalent (ROTATEQ), diphtheria toxoid, pertussis vaccine (unspecified), tetanus toxoid, poliovirus vaccine inactivated (unspecified), pneumococcal conj vaccine (unspecified) and hib conj vaccine (unspecified carrier). Within 12 hours of vaccine administration, he became colicky. A day later, he began developing blisters filled with clear fluid that became confluent. The areas most affected included the back (which was covered with extensive bullae), skin fold areas of the upper arms, and the lower abdomen distant from the area of injection. He had no fever and was in no acute distress. He was treated with a 5-day course of low-dose oral steroids and recovered with no residual skin changes.   A copy of the published article is attached as further documentation of the patient's experience.  Literature Report:   Follow up information has been received from the authors of a published literature article, titled as stated below. It was reported that the patient was vaccinated with Rotavirus Vaccine, Live, Oral, Pentavalent (ROTATEQ) Orally (dose, frequency, lot number and expiration date were not reported) and Hemophilus influenzae B, conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV), poliomyelitis (inactivated), and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid at one visit concomitantly.

Prior to receiving quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL), the pt was able to work longer hours, go to school, and stay engaged in family and social relationships. No other information concerning the pt's medical history, concurrent conditions or concomitant medications was provided. On 09-SEP-2019, at the age of 26 years old, the pt received her first dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for preventing cervical cancer. On 25-OCT-2019, the pt received her second dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for preventing cervical cancer. On unspecified dates, after receiving the first and second vaccinations, the pt began experiencing fatigue, falling asleep while driving, falling asleep while talking, excessive daytime sleepiness, and exacerbation of pre-existing anxiety. On 12-JUN-2020, the pt received her third dose of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not reported) for preventing cervical cancer. On unspecified dates, after receiving the third vaccination, the pt's symptoms worsened and she began experiencing joint pain, joint inflammation, neck stiffness, neck pain, decreased range of motion, brain fog, shortness of breath, exacerbation of pre-existing depression and headaches, and exacerbation of fatigue, falling asleep while driving, falling asleep while talking, and excessive daytime sleepiness. As a result of her post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms, the pt has been unable to engage in activities that a normal young person would enjoy. Her fatigue and sleep issues overwhelm her life. She falls asleep at work and even while driving. Her joint pain makes it difficult to complete daily personal and professional responsibilities. On unknown dates, based upon her chronic and severe post-quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms, the pt has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to, idiopathic hypersomnia and fibromyalgia. The pt sustained serious autoimmune, autonomic, and neurological injuries as a result of her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) injection. The pt contended that her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) injection(s) caused her to develop and exacerbate serious and debilitating autoimmune, autonomic, and neurological injuries and resulting sequelae, including but not limited to idiopathic hypersomnia and fibromyalgia, as well as a constellation of adverse symptoms, complications, injuries, and other adverse events, many of which were alleged herein and all of which were caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL) or otherwise linked to her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced autoimmune disorder. The pt has suffered at the time of report and continued to suffer severe and permanent physical injuries and associated symptomology and had suffered severe and permanent emotional injuries, including pain and suffering. She also has a substantial fear of suffering additional and ongoing harms, including but not limited to now being at an increased risk of cancer, and future symptoms and harms associated with her autoimmune disease and other injuries caused by quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL). As a direct and proximate result of her quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced injuries, the pt had suffered and at the time of report continued to suffer economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished income capacity, and she would continue to incur these losses and expenses in the future. The outcome of the events of autonomic neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, idiopathic hypersomnia, fibromyalgia, exacerbation of anxiety, arthritis and depression aggravated was considered to be not recovered.  The lawyer considered the events of autonomic neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, idiopathic hypersomnia, fibromyalgia, exacerbation of anxiety, arthritis and depression aggravated to be related to quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine (GARDASIL).

This report was referenced in literature: and concerned a patient of unspecified age and sex (subject number and site number were not reported). The patients height and weight were not reported. Age at time of vaccination was unknown. Aim- Anecdotal reports of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) following COVID-19 vaccination have emerged in the otolaryngology community. Studies have demonstrated no association between COVID-19 vaccination and SSNHL. We aim to characterize the spectrum of otologic symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination.  No past medical history, concurrent conditions or pre-existing medical conditions were reported.  The patients received janssen covid-19 vaccine (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number not reported) dose, frequency and therapy dates not reported, additional dosage information included: dose series 1, for covid-19 prophylaxis. The batch number was not reported. The company is unable to perform follow up.  No concomitant medications were reported.  Methods- Patients presenting to the otology clinic at a tertiary care, urban medical center between May and July 2021 were screened with a short questionnaire for development of otologic symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination. Patients were  inquired about  previous COVID-19 infection, method and date of diagnosis if previously infected, COVID- 19  vaccination status,  and  vaccine brand  and  dates  if  vaccinated. Screened symptoms included hearing loss,  tinnitus, ear  drainage, dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, facial nerve palsy, smell change, and taste change; patients were specifically asked if such symptoms appeared during active COVID-19 infection or within 4 weeks of any dose of COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, demographic data, including age and gender, were obtained. All above uses of patient data were approved by the Regulatory Authority. For patients reporting any otologic symptoms, a retrospective chart review was performed to collect audiometric data and final diagnoses. Audiometric data from the initial presentation were gathered and notes written by the primary otologist were reviewed for relevant medical history, diagnoses, and treatments. Pearson's chi-square test was used to evaluate for significant differences in vaccination proportions. On an unspecified date, the patients experienced sensorineural hearing loss, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, cerumen impaction, temporomandibular joint disorder, presbycusis, injection site pain, fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Dose series 1. Results- Between May and July 2021, 500 patients were screened. Median age was 56.6 years old, with 59.4 % female and 40.2 % male. 420 patients (84.0 %) were vaccinated, with 58.4 % receiving Pfizer, 29.1 % receiving Moderna, and 3.8 % receiving Johnson & Johnson. 61 patients (14.5 %) reported one or more otologic symptoms within 4 weeks of vaccination, including 21 (5.0 %) with hearing loss, 26 (6.2 %) with tinnitus, 33 (7.9 %) with dizziness, and 19 (4.5 %) with vertigo. Of the 16 patients (3.2 %) reporting tinnitus with no associated hearing loss, 8 were diagnosed with subjective tinnitus and 4 were diagnosed with temporomandibular joint syndrome. Of the 18 patients reporting hearing loss, 11 had exacerbations of underlying pathologies (e.g. Meniere's disease, presbycusis) and 7 were newly diagnosed with SSNHL (1.4 %). The action taken with janssen covid-19 vaccine was not applicable.  The outcome of sensorineural hearing loss, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, cerumen impaction, temporomandibular joint disorder, presbycusis, injection site pain, fever, fatigue, myalgia and headache was not reported.  The reporter considered the causality between janssen covid-19 vaccine and sensorineural hearing loss, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, cerumen impaction, temporomandibular joint disorder, presbycusis, injection site pain, fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache as not reported. Company causality between janssen covid-19 vaccine and Vertigo positional, Cerumen impaction, Temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome, Presbyacusis, sensorineural hearing loss, injection site pain, fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache was not related. Conclusion- Patients reporting otologic symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination received various diagnoses of uncertain etiology. The incidence of SSNHL in these patients is comparable to the general otology patient population. Additional studies are  required to  determine the  incidence of  specific diagnoses following vaccination.    This report was serious (other medically important condition).; Sender's Comments: V0-Deafness neurosensory, Vertigo positional, Cerumen impaction,  Temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndromePresbyacusis.

On 17-Nov-2024 patient was vaccinated with the Afluria 24-25 TIV LA/RA flu vaccine. Prior to being vaccinated he was in excellent health. Since the vaccine, his health has plummeted, and the quality of my life was dramatically reduced. When he said ""excellent health"" he was not exaggerating. He was routinely hiking ten miles with dogs, strenuously working out, working hard around property and much more physically fit than most 30-year-olds but he was older than that. Two days after being vaccinated he had a severe outbreak of genital herpes, which he had not occurrences of for at least three years prior and at that time (three years prior), the outbreak was very mild. He had not for many years had any significant genital herpes outbreaks. The outbreak which started on 19-Nov-2024 was immediately followed by another severe outbreak, as this subsided, it was followed by yet another outbreak and then another outbreak after that. He now had pain in his buttocks, hamstrings, lower back and calves which come along with herpes outbreaks. In addition to the extreme discomfort this had had a devastating effect on my relationship with my partner. He had shingles as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome in 2019 which had been in remission but following the vaccination on 17-Nov-2024 now had the symptoms of that again. This included pain in eardrums, pain in ears, ringing in ears, pain on the sides of head, pain in eyes, pinching of skin, pain on torso, pinching on torso, pinching in legs. It was extremely disturbing that he had so much pain on the unaffected side of his head and he was very concerned that would be stricken with Ramsay Hunt on that side, which would destroy his health. Additionally he had some autoimmune dysfunction in the mid 2000s, which was of unknown origin and which spent a lot of money and time to lift himself out of with rest, careful diet and exercise and medication. He had been symptom free of that since about 2012 and stopped taking any medication for those symptoms in about 2017, but now the symptoms of that had returned. He had pains throughout his body, especially at the site of old injuries. He had neck pain, back pain, pain in the bottoms of his feet, pain in the palms of his hands, odd pains in his forearms. He had frequent headaches now, and he almost never have had headaches in his life. Prior to 17-Nov-2024, when received the Afluria vaccination, he was extremely physically fit. He worked out twice each week in the gym, doing very strenuous workouts and rarely missing that exercise. He performed three sets of ten pullups, five sets of squats, hip thrusts, leg curls, calf raises, barbell rowing on one day and bench presses, shoulder presses, bar dips, planks, upright rows, dumbell raises on the other day. Now, exactly two months later, he was unable to work out. He tried a workout two days before and it had resulted in a worsening of symptoms. The normal post exercise pain that one might experience after a workout was replaced with odd and scary feelings in his muscles. He had to visit health care provider for additional anti-virals to try to keep these herpes infections at bay and he was forced to take double and triple the dosage. He had often nauseas now and did not  know if it was a side effect from all the anti-virals or a side effect of the Afluria vaccination. He was an adult and recently started a new job which was critical for his family's wellbeing. The job required travel, which had had to do with the miserable symptoms. He had to put on a happy face in meetings while experience these pains and other terrifying symptoms  Afluria (TIV) action taken: Not Applicable  Reporter assessment: the reporter did not provide a seriousness and causality assessment for the events.; Reporter's Comments: Causality: Related for all the events.

The pt's medical history, concurrent conditions, and concomitant medications were not provided. On 23-APR-2021 (when she was 30-years old), the pt was inoculated with the first dose of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) intramuscular injection as prevention of cervical cancer (dose, route of administration, anatomical location, lot number, and expiration date were not provided). Subsequently on 22-APR-2022, she received the second dose of the vaccine (Inappropriate schedule of product administration), both vaccines were administered under her physician's recommendation. On approximately 30-APR-2021 (reported as ""within approximately a week from receiving the first Gardasil injection""), the pt began experiencing unusual joint pain. The pain began at the knees and progressed to the pt's shoulder joints and smaller joints. In addition, she began experiencing daily POTS-like (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) symptoms, including tachycardia, dizziness, postural hypotension, and abdominal pain. Due to the abdominal pain, she made reoccurring visits to the hospital. As well as relied on medications such as hydroxychloroquine (PLAQUENIL) and various over-the-counter pain relief items like heat wraps, lidocaine patches, NSAID creams, and more. Unfortunately, none of these remedied the pain. Moreover, on an unknown date, the pt was diagnosed with elevated antinuclear antibodies, low-grade fevers, severe chronic pain, loss of range of motion, weakness, and lack of control of some muscles and fingers, and bowel inflammation. Post vaccination, the pt visited numerous specialists to evaluate her symptoms, such as an orthopedist, gastroenterologist, rheumatologist, and the emergency room. Thus, she was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia. As the months progressed, so did the pt's injuries. She was seen by multiple physicians and specialists for her complaints which now included: joint pain, tachycardia dizziness, POTS-like symptoms, postural hypotension, abdominal pain, low-grade fevers, chronic pain, loss of range of motion, weakness, muscle function loss, bowel inflammation, and elevated antinuclear antibodies levels. As a result of her post Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) symptoms, the pt has been unable to engage in activities that a normal young person would enjoy. As the sole caregiver and a healthcare professional, her career has been significantly impacted by the physical limitations caused by these symptoms. She was no longer able to complete a full shift without experiencing considerable pain and now depended on lidocaine patches for relief. Additionally, the medications that help her manage these symptoms have severely restricted her ability to pursue her personal aspirations, such as traveling, making such goals nearly impossible to achieve. Furthermore, the medication prescribed to manage her symptoms carries the risk of causing blindness, instilling a profound fear for the long-term quality of her life and future. Based upon her chronic and severe symptoms, the pt has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including but not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, and POTS-like symptoms. In addition, the pt contended that her Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) injections caused her to develop serious and debilitating autoimmune and autonomic injuries, including but not limited to psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, and POTS-like symptoms, as well as a constellation of adverse events symptoms, complications, injuries, and other adverse events, many of which were alleged herein and all of which were caused by Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) or otherwise linked to her Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL)-induced autoimmune and autonomic disorder. Moreover, the pt sustained that The Company's negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries, harm, and economic losses that she suffered, and will continue to suffer, as described herein. Additionally, as a direct and proximate result of her vaccine-induced injuries the pt has suffered considerable non-economic and economic losses, including considerable financial expenses for medical care and treatment, and diminished income capacity and will continue to incur. The patient had not recovered from the adverse events, and it was considered the events to be related to Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL).

Her entire body was hurting due to swelling, especially in her hands, fingers, and ankles. Physician prescribed steroids, but she continued to experience pain for months.  Pt. was eventually diagnosed with autoimmune Lupus (Systemic lupus erythematosus). She had also been diagnosed with histoplasmosis, endometriosis, and had had a full hysterectomy. She continued to experience severe daily pain and fatigue. She has had clots removed from her legs several times (Thrombectomy), as well as lumps removed from her throat (Mass excision). She experienced abdominal pain and difficulty swallowing (Dysphagia) and had lost significant weight (Weight decreased). She had had a feeding tube placed (Gastrointestinal tube insertion) and must use it to take her daily medications.  Before Vaccination, pt. was very active outdoors. She jogged every morning and was always at their children's school functions. She would go swimming and work out at her local GYM. She enjoyed having fun with her family. They would take trips to theme parks. Since the Gardasil vaccine, Pt's life had changed from a normal, healthy, active person to barely being able to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. She had a long-term goal of starting her own restaurant, but that has changed due to her health.  She could no longer participate in her children's school functions, go on trips, or do fun things with her family.
